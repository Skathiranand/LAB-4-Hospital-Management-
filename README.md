# Exp - 4 HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
## AIM:
To develop the Hospital management System using Star UML tool.
## PROCEDURE :
### USECASE :
Identified the primary Actors (Patient, Doctor, Nurse, Receptionist, Admin) and mapped all their key functions (e.g., Schedule Appointment, Write Prescription, Manage Appointments) to define the system's functional boundary.

### CLASS :
Defined all necessary Classes (Patient, Doctors, Receptionist, Department, Bill, Admin), specified their essential Attributes and Methods, and established the relationships between them to form the system's conceptual data model.

### PACKAGE : 
Grouped components into four high-level, logical Packages (Patients, Doctors, Receptionist, Nurse) and mapped the dependencies between these modules, showing how different hospital sections rely on each other.

### SEQUENCE : 
Detailed the exact sequence of messages between lifelines (Patient, Receptionist, Doctor, Nurse) for a complete appointment and consultation process, from Takes Appointment $\rightarrow$ Consult Doctor $\rightarrow$ Prescribe Test/Medicine $\rightarrow$ Make Payment.

### ACTIVITY : 
Charted the complete control flow for a Patient's Visit, including decision points for admission and operation. The flow covers assign doctor, suggest treatment, room allocation, operation, and culminates in prepare bill and make payment.

### COMMUNICATION :
Placed the interacting objects and used numbered arrows to model the sequential message exchange for the Appointment and Treatment flow, highlighting interactions like Takes Appointment , Consults Doctor , Treat Patient , and Make Payment.
